# Student Record Management System in C

### Problem Statement  
Design and implement a **Student Record Management System** that stores roll numbers, names, and marks, and allows searching (linear/binary search) and sorting (merge/quick sort) of students.

This project provides a menu-driven C program to efficiently manage student academic records using arrays, structures, and fundamental searching/sorting algorithms.

## Features
- Add a new student  
- Store roll number, name, number of subjects, and marks  
- Auto-calculate total and average  
- Search students using:
  - Linear Search  
  - Binary Search  
- Sort students using:
  - Quick Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
- Display all students in a tabular format  
- Update student details  
- Menu-driven and user-friendly
